**Total Expenses: $1900 / month or ~$65 / day**

You can play around with excluding/including some of these services but if you are subscribed to all of them then **your account needs to be profiting an average of ~$65 / day** to break even.

And you need to be using up to at least 1k dollar trade sizes. Needless to say, an optimal setup is a big investment!
